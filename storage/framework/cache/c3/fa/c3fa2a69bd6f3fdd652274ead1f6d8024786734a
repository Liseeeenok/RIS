There is an increasing awareness of the need for quality research management (information) systems:

* for researchers: easy access to relevant information and associated software, processor power, storage systems and - where necessary - detectors to collect more data to overcome incomplete or inconsistent information
* for research managers and administrators: easy measurement and analysis of research activity and easy access to comparative information
* for research councils: optimisation of the funding process
* for entrepreneurs and technology transfer organizations: easy retrieval of novel ideas and technology in a knowledge-assisted environment and easy identification of competitors and previously done similar research
* for the media and public: easy access to information, software and computer power to allow easily assimilated presentation of research results in appropriate contexts.
 

A standard for current research information system is the CERIF (Common European Research Information Format) standard, proposed by the EU and developed and maintained by euroCRIS.
